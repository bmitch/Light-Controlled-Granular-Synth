Light Controlled Granular Synth (Make Noise With The New Arduino Kit!)

This code is part of a project called 'Make Noise With The New Arduino Kit!'

You can see the full video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7DOBV43UPQ

We were supposed to write a review for the new Arduino Starter Kit, but we did a project instead, so people can actually enjoy their kit!

We started from two of the projects you can find in the book that comes with the kit, Light Theremin (http://youtu.be/57S3dylfw3I) and Crystal Ball (http://youtu.be/TirVG6tmTnQ), and hacked an existing project called The Arduino Synthesizer (http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Arduino-Synthesizer/ - based on Auduino)

So we created a Light Controlled Granular Synth which features:

two oscillators
two LDRs to control the pitch for each oscillator
two potentiometers to control the decay for each oscillator
one LDR to control the grains repetition frequency
one LCD display
one button to choose from different modes and scales
We only used components that you can find into the Arduino Starter Kit (except for a speaker) so everyone can easily replicate the project.

Into the repo you can find the Arduino code and the Fritzing file for the circuit.

Have fun and make some noise!
